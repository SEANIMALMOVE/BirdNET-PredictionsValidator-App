# BirdNET Predictions Validator App

BirdNET Predictions Validator App is a Gradio-based Python application designed to facilitate the validation of bird species predictions generated by BirdNET. The app allows users to visualize, listen to audio segments, and record the accuracy of predictions in a downloadable CSV file. This tool aims to be a public resource for ornithologists, bird enthusiasts, and developers to validate and improve bird species prediction models.

</div>

#### Installation on Windows

1. **Download the Installer**: Download the Windows installer from the [Download Windows Installer](https://github.com/GrunCrow/BirdNET-PredictionsValidator-App/releases/download/v1.3/app_windows.exe) link.
2. **Run the Installer**: Double-click the downloaded `.exe` file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the application.

#### Installation on Linux

1. **Download the Installer**: Download the Linux installer from the [Download Linux Installer](https://github.com/GrunCrow/BirdNET-PredictionsValidator-App/releases/download/v1.3/app_linux) link.
2. **Run the Installer**: Run the following command:

```bash
./app_linux
```

#### Running the Application

1. **Create a `Bird Vocalization Sample` Folder**: In the same directory as the executable file, create a folder named `Bird Vocalization Sample`. Within this folder, create subfolders named after each bird species (using the BirdNET format). Populate these subfolders with `.WAV` files containing sample vocalizations for each species. While this step is not mandatory, it is highly recommended as it allows the application to display sample vocalizations from your dataset alongside the data you are validating.
2. **Select Audios Folder**: Choose the folder containing the audio files you want to validate.

For a detailed walkthrough, please refer to the video tutorial above.
